Game Blackjack. Blackjack is a classic casino card game of luck and strategy.

General task: implement the card game Blackjack.

Rules of the game: Blackjack can be played by 1 to 7 players. One standard 52-card deck is shuffled. Each player gets an initial hand of two cards visible to the people playing on it. The dealer's hand gets its first card face down, and, a second card gets face up. The object of the game is to win by creating card totals higher than those of the dealer's hand but not exceeding 21, or by stopping at a total in the hope that dealer will bust. On their turn, players choose to "hit"(take a card) or "stand" (end their turn and stop without taking a card). Number cards count as theirnumber, the jack, queen, and king count as 10, and aces count as either 1 or 11 according to the player's choice. If the total exceeds 21 points, it busts, and player immediately lose. After the players have finished playing, dealer show its first card. The dealer's hand is resolved by drawing cards until the hand achieves a total of 17 or higher. If the dealer busts, all remaining player hands win. If the dealer does not bust, each remaining bet wins if its hand is higher than the dealer's and loses if it is lower. If the player and the dealer have the same number of points in their hands, then this situation is called a push. In such a situation, no one wins or loses.
